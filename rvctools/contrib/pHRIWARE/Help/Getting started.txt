Getting started with pHRIWARE is easy. Simply download the zip file from this Google Code site, then extract all of the files onto your MATLAB path.

Then in your MATLAB command window, run pHRIWARE.m to read a little about it, and then select 'y' when prompted to see some demos on how to use the toolbox's features.

In the Help folder, you will also find a couple of extra resources to help with certain aspects of pHRIWARE.
