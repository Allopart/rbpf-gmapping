%ISVEC Test if vector
%
% ISVEC(V) is true (1) if the argument V is a 3-vector, else false (0).
%
% ISVEC(V, L) is true (1) if the argument V is a vector of length L,
% either a row- or column-vector.  Otherwise false (0).
%
% Notes::
% - Differs from MATLAB builtin function ISVECTOR, the latter returns true
%   for the case of a scalar, ISVEC does not.
% - Gives same result for row- or column-vector, ie. 3x1 or 1x3 gives true.
