%MULTIDFPRINTF Print formatted text to multiple streams
%
% COUNT = MULTIDFPRINTF(IDVEC, FORMAT, A, ...) performs formatted output
% to multiple streams such as console and files.  FORMAT is the format string 
% as used by sprintf and fprintf.  A is the array of elements, to which the 
% format will be applied similar to sprintf and fprint.  
%
% IDVEC is a vector (1xN) of file descriptors and COUNT is a vector (1xN) of
% the number of bytes written to each file.
%
% Notes::
% - To write to the consolde use the file identifier 1.
%
% Example::
%         % Create and open a new example file:
%         fid = fopen('exampleFile.txt','w+');
%         % Write something to the file and the console simultaneously:
%         multidfprintf([1 FID],'% s % d % d % d!\n','This is a test!',1,2,3);
%         % Close the file:
%         fclose(FID);
