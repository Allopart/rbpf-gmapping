%ISHOMOG Test if SE(3) homogeneous transformation
%
% ISHOMOG(T) is true (1) if the argument T is of dimension 4x4 or 4x4xN, else 
% false (0).
%
% ISHOMOG(T, 'valid') as above, but also checks the validity of the rotation
% sub-matrix.
%
% Notes::
% - The first form is a fast, but incomplete, test for a transform is SE(3).
% - Does not work for the SE(2) case.
%
% See also ISROT, ISVEC.
