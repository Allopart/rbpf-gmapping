%SerialLink.perturb Perturb robot parameters
%
% RP = R.perturb(P) is a new robot object in which the dynamic parameters (link
% mass and inertia) have been perturbed.  The perturbation is multiplicative so 
% that values are multiplied by random numbers in the interval (1-P) to (1+P).
% The name string of the perturbed robot is prefixed by 'P/'.
%
% Useful for investigating the robustness of various model-based control 
% schemes. For example to vary parameters in the range +/- 10 percent is:
%    r2 = p560.perturb(0.1);
