%SerialLink.friction Friction force
%
% TAU = R.friction(QD) is the vector of joint friction forces/torques for the 
% robot moving with joint velocities QD.  
%
% The friction model includes:
% - Viscous friction which is a linear function of velocity.
% - Coulomb friction which is proportional to sign(QD).
%
% See also Link.friction.
