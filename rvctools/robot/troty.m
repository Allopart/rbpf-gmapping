%TROTY Rotation about Y axis
%
% T = TROTY(THETA) is a homogeneous transformation (4x4) representing a rotation 
% of THETA radians about the y-axis.
%
% T = TROTY(THETA, 'deg') as above but THETA is in degrees.
%
% Notes::
% - Translational component is zero.
%
% See also ROTY, TROTX, TROTZ, TROT2.
