%DELTA2TR Convert differential motion  to a homogeneous transform
%
% T = DELTA2TR(D) is a homogeneous transform (4x4) representing differential 
% translation and rotation. The vector D=(dx, dy, dz, dRx, dRy, dRz)
% represents an infinitessimal motion, and is an approximation to the spatial 
% velocity multiplied by time.
