\chapter{Abstract}
Rao-Blackwellized Particle filters have been introduced in simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) effectively in the past years. Improved techniques have helped reduce the number of particles needed and allowed a faster and more robust solution. These solutions can be seen, and used, in the C++ ROS \textit{gmapping} package. This manual presents the conversion to a simpler but easy-to-understand \textit{MatLab} implementation and will describe the RBPF-SLAM principle in a similar manner.
